  def caveats
    <<~EOS
      zvcs installs the git-shadowing binary as `zvcs`, so it never clobbers
      the git formula. One command installs the shadow and prints the shell
      lines that activate it:

        zvcs zshadow

      Put those lines in your shell rc (or eval them in this shell):

        eval "$(zvcs zshadow)"

      They put ~/.zvcs/bin ahead of stock git on PATH (a `git` symlink to
      this binary, plus a `git-<verb>` link for every verb), ~/.zvcs/man on
      MANPATH, and the zvcs zsh completion on fpath. In a new shell, `git`
      is served by zvcs; drop the PATH line to undo it.

      Re-run `zvcs zshadow` after `brew upgrade` so the symlink follows the
      new build.
